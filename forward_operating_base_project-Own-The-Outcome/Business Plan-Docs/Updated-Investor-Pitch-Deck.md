# Forward Operating Base - Investor Pitch Deck
## Eliminating Veteran Homelessness Through Coordinated Community Resources

---

## 🎯 **THE PROBLEM**

### **The Real Issue: Coordination, Not Resources**
- Restaurants throw away 80 billion pounds of food annually
- Construction companies need skilled labor
- Real estate agents struggle with veteran clients
- Finance brokers lack veteran-specific tools
