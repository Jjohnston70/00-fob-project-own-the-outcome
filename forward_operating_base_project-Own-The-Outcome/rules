# Forward Operating Base - Development Rules & Standards

## CRITICAL: Always Read First
# Always read memory-bank/architecture.md before writing any code. Include entire database schema.
# Always read memory-bank/implementation-plan.md before writing any code.
# After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update memory-bank/architecture.md.
# Always read the README.md file first and make updates with checkmarks as we complete tasks and steps.
# Never move on to next step without asking first.
# Never edit .env files or dot files without explicit permission.
