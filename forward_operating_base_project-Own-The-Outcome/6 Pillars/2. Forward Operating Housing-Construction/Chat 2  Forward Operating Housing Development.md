I'm developing "Forward Operating Housing" - the housing security pillar that coordinates builder resources with veteran housing projects.

Components:
- Builder project management automation (3 builders per city)
- Volunteer coordination for construction projects
- Material donation tracking and coordination
- Construction timeline and resource optimization
- Integration with real estate agents for housing placement

Tech stack: Supabase backend, React frontend, mobile-responsive design, integration with construction management tools.

I need:
1. Project management platform architecture
2. Volunteer scheduling and coordination system
3. Material donation tracking and inventory management
4. Integration with existing construction software (Procore, PlanGrid)
5. Mobile app for on-site coordination
6. Timeline optimization algorithms
7. Database schema for multi-project coordination

Revenue model: $5K setup + $600/month per builder.

Help me build construction project coordination that turns donated materials and volunteer labor into veteran housing solutions.
