I'm developing "Forward Operating Fuel" - the logistics pillar that coordinates fuel partnerships for delivery and construction operations.



Components:

\- Corporate fuel partnership management (Chief Petroleum primary target)

\- Route optimization for delivery vehicles

\- Fuel cost tracking and optimization

\- Integration with all other pillars for logistics coordination

\- Fleet fuel management and scheduling



Tech stack: Route optimization algorithms, fuel tracking APIs, fleet management integration, mobile driver app.



I need:

1\. Corporate partnership coordination platform

2\. Route optimization and fuel efficiency algorithms

3\. Fuel cost tracking and budget management

4\. Integration with Forward Operating Table delivery coordination

5\. Integration with Forward Operating Housing construction logistics

6\. Fleet fuel management and scheduling system

7\. Mobile app for drivers and fuel coordination



Revenue model: $1K setup + $200/month per fuel supplier, plus cost savings sharing with operational partners.



Partnership focus: Chief Petroleum corporate partnership for fuel donations/discounts enabling all Forward Operating Base logistics.



Help me build fuel coordination that enables sustainable logistics for the entire veteran support ecosystem.
