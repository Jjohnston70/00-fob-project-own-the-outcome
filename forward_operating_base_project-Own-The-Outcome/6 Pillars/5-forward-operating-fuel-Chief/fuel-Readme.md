Forward Operating Fuel - README.md

Mission Statement

"Fuel the logistics that enable veteran independence through optimized fuel partnerships and route coordination across all Forward Operating Base operations."

Pillar Overview

Forward Operating Fuel is the logistics coordination pillar that enables sustainable transportation across the entire Forward Operating Base ecosystem. This pillar manages corporate fuel partnerships, optimizes delivery routes, tracks fuel consumption, and coordinates the vehicles that deliver food, transport veterans to housing appointments, and support construction operations.

Core Principle: Every gallon saved is a dollar that goes directly to serving more veterans.

Forward Operating Housing: Construction vehicles require fuel for materials transport

Forward Operating Intel: Real estate agents need fuel for property showings with veterans

Forward Operating Capital: Finance brokers need fuel for client meetings and document delivery

Forward Operating Mobility: Vehicle delivery and emergency transportation requires fuel coordination
