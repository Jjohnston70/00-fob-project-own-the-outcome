I'm developing "Forward Operating Intel" - the real estate intelligence pillar that leverages agent networks for veteran housing placement.

Components:
- Real estate agent CRM enhancement (5 agents per city, veteran agents prioritized)
- MLS integration and property intelligence
- Veteran-specific property matching algorithms
- Market analysis and timing optimization
- Integration with Forward Operating Capital for financing coordination

Tech stack: React CRM enhancement, MLS API integrations, AI-powered matching, mobile-responsive design.

I need:
1. Enhanced CRM architecture for veteran client management
2. MLS integration specifications and data processing
3. AI-powered property matching algorithms
4. Market intelligence dashboard and analytics
5. Mobile app for agents and veteran clients
6. Integration APIs with major real estate platforms
7. Predictive analytics for market timing

Revenue model: $2K setup + $500/month per agent, plus commission sharing on veteran transactions.

Help me build real estate intelligence that turns market data into veteran housing opportunities.
