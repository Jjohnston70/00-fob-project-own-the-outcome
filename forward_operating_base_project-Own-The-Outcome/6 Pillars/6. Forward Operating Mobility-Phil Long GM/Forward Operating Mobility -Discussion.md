Forward Operating Mobility (Transportation Independence)

Call Phil Long Ford GM and say:

"I'm building a veteran-led platform that eliminates veteran homelessness through coordinated community resources. We've got food security, housing, real estate intelligence, and financing covered. The missing piece is reliable transportation. Your Special Forces Foundation gives us instant credibility, and I can show you how this generates significant revenue while serving veterans. Can we meet this week?"
