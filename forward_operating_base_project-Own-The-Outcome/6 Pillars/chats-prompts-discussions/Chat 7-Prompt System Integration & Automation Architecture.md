I'm developing the complete Forward Operating Base ecosystem integration - 6 pillars working together as one coordinated platform.

Integration Requirements:
- Forward Operating Table (food) coordinates with Mobility (delivery vehicles) and Fuel (logistics)
- Forward Operating Intel (real estate) coordinates with Capital (financing) and Housing (construction)
- All pillars share veteran client data and coordinate services
- Centralized impact tracking and reporting across all pillars
- Multi-tenant architecture for city licensing and expansion

Tech stack: Microservices architecture, shared database, API gateway, real-time synchronization, mobile-first design.

I need:
1. Complete system architecture for 6-pillar integration
2. Shared database schema and data synchronization
3. API gateway and microservices coordination
4. Real-time communication between pillars
5. Centralized veteran client management across all services
6. Impact tracking and reporting across the ecosystem
7. Multi-tenant architecture for city licensing
8. Mobile app coordination across all pillars

This needs to handle multi-city deployment, licensing to veteran entrepreneurs, and integration with corporate partners across all verticals.

Help me build the technical backbone that coordinates all 6 pillars into one seamless veteran support ecosystem.
