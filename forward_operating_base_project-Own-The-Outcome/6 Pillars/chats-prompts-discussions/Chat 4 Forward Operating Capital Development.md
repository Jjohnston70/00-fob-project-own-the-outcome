I'm developing "Forward Operating Capital" - the financial services pillar that coordinates veteran-specific financing through broker networks.

Components:
- Finance broker CRM integration (2 brokers per city, veteran brokers prioritized)
- VA benefit optimization automation
- Credit monitoring and improvement tracking
- Loan application streamlining and coordination
- Integration with Forward Operating Intel for housing finance timing

Tech stack: Enhanced CRM, credit monitoring APIs, VA benefit integration, automated underwriting coordination.

I need:
1. Broker CRM enhancement architecture
2. VA benefit optimization algorithms and automation
3. Credit monitoring and improvement tracking systems
4. Loan application automation and coordination
5. Integration with veteran-friendly lenders
6. Financial planning and optimization tools
7. Mobile app for brokers and veteran clients

Revenue model: $2.5K setup + $600/month per broker, plus commission sharing on veteran loans.

Help me build financial coordination that removes economic barriers to veteran housing and entrepreneurship.
