Forward Operating Housing (Housing Security)

Call local veteran builders and say:

"I'm building a veteran-led platform that eliminates veteran homelessness, and I need builders who understand the mission. This isn't charity work - it's coordinated project management that gets you tax benefits, community recognition, and steady work while housing veterans. As someone who served/supports veterans, want to see how this creates sustainable revenue while serving our brothers and sisters? Can we meet this week?"
