I'm setting up GitHub repositories for Forward Operating Base - a 6-pillar veteran support ecosystem that will be licensed to multiple cities.



Repository Structure Needed:

\- Monorepo vs. multi-repo strategy for 6 distinct but integrated pillars

\- Each pillar has its own automation, mobile app, and integration requirements

\- Shared components for veteran client management and impact tracking

\- City licensing and multi-tenant deployment capabilities

\- CI/CD pipeline for rapid deployment and updates



Pillar Repositories:

1\. forward-operating-table (food security automation)

2\. forward-operating-housing (construction project management)

3\. forward-operating-intel (real estate intelligence)

4\. forward-operating-capital (financial services coordination)

5\. forward-operating-mobility (vehicle and transportation)

6\. forward-operating-fuel (logistics and fuel coordination)



Plus: fob-core (shared components), fob-mobile (unified mobile app), fob-licensing (multi-tenant platform)



I need:

1\. Optimal GitHub repository structure and organization

2\. Development workflow and branching strategy

3\. CI/CD pipeline setup for multi-city deployment

4\. Shared component management across pillars

5\. Documentation structure for each repository

6\. Licensing and multi-tenant deployment strategy

7\. Code organization for rapid scaling and maintenance



Tech stack: React, Node.js, Firebase/Supabase, mobile React Native, microservices architecture.



Help me structure this for rapid development, easy maintenance, and seamless city licensing deployment.
