I'm developing "Forward Operating Mobility" - the transportation pillar that ensures veteran vehicle access through dealership partnerships.

Components:
- Car dealership CRM integration (1-2 dealerships per city)
- Veteran transportation needs assessment
- Vehicle matching and financing coordination
- Fleet management for Forward Operating Base operations
- Integration with Forward Operating Capital for vehicle financing

Tech stack: Dealership CRM enhancement, vehicle matching algorithms, fleet management platform, mobile coordination app.

I need:
1. Dealership CRM integration architecture
2. Veteran transportation assessment and matching system
3. Fleet management platform for operational vehicles
4. Vehicle financing coordination with capital pillar
5. Mobile app for dealership staff and veterans
6. Integration with manufacturer veteran programs
7. Maintenance scheduling and fleet optimization

Revenue model: $4.5K setup + $1.1K/month per dealership, plus commission sharing on veteran vehicle sales.

Partnership focus: Phil Long Ford (GM runs Special Forces foundation) - immediate credibility and veteran network access.

Help me build transportation coordination that ensures every veteran has reliable vehicle access for employment and housing stability.
