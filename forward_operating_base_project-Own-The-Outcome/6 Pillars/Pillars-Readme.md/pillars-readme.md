## Code Style & Architecture Principles

### Veteran-Centric Development
- Build for **non-developers who get tech** - clear, commented, modular code
- Include **comprehensive logging** for troubleshooting and optimization
- Create **reusable components** that work across all 6 pillars
- Document **business logic and veteran-specific requirements**
- Design for **multi-city deployment** from day one

### Enterprise-Grade Standards
- **Modular architecture** - each pillar can function independently
- **API-first design** - enable integrations with existing systems
- **Mobile-responsive** - veterans and partners need mobile access
- **Real-time coordination** - food delivery, construction, housing placement
- **Multi-tenant capable** - support city licensing from the start

### Security & Compliance
- **Veteran data protection** - HIPAA-level security for sensitive information
- **Financial compliance** - SOC 2 standards for financial data handling
- **Audit trails** - comprehensive logging for accountability
- **Role-based access** - different permissions for partners vs. administrators
- **Disaster recovery** - protect veteran services from system failures

## Documentation Standards

### Each Pillar Requires
- **Technical Architecture** - system design and integration points
- **Business Requirements** - partner needs and veteran outcomes
- **API Documentation** - integration specifications for partners
- **Deployment Guide** - city licensing implementation procedures
- **Training Materials** - partner onboarding and system usage
- **Impact Metrics** - success measurement and reporting

### Project Management
- Update `progress.md` after each milestone completion
- Document architecture decisions in `architecture.md`
- Keep PRD current with evolving requirements
- Create handoff documentation for city licensing
- Maintain comprehensive API documentation

## Testing & Validation Strategy

### Veteran Impact Validation
- **Real veteran outcomes** - housing placements, food security, employment
- **Partner satisfaction** - restaurant owners, builders, agents, brokers, dealers
- **Financial performance** - cost savings, tax benefits, revenue generation
- **Operational efficiency** - coordination speed, waste reduction, service quality
- **Community integration** - veteran engagement and long-term stability

### Technical Validation
- **Cross-pillar integration** - ensure seamless data flow between systems
- **Scale testing** - validate performance with full partner loads
- **Mobile responsiveness** - test on devices veterans and partners actually use
- **Data accuracy** - verify inventory, scheduling, and financial calculations
- **Security penetration** - protect veteran and partner data

## Partnership Development Framework

### Immediate Priorities (This Week)
1. **Neighbor Restaurant** - Forward Operating Table pilot
2. **Veteran Real Estate Agent** - Forward Operating Intel pilot
3. **Veteran Finance Broker** - Forward Operating Capital pilot
4. **Phil Long Ford GM** - Forward Operating Mobility partnership
5. **Chief Petroleum** - Forward Operating Fuel partnership

### Partnership Success Metrics
- **Revenue per partner** - platform fees + commission sharing
- **Veteran impact per partner** - measurable outcomes for veteran community
- **Partner retention rate** - long-term partnership sustainability
- **Cross-pillar utilization** - veterans using multiple services
- **Referral generation** - partners referring other potential partners

## Critical Success Factors

### Veteran Leadership Requirements
- **Veteran founder credibility** - 100% disabled veteran leading the mission
- **Veteran partner preference** - prioritize veteran-owned businesses
- **Veteran employee hiring** - preference for veteran staff across all operations
- **Veteran advisory board** - minimum 60% veteran representation
- **Veteran impact measurement** - track veteran outcomes, not just business metrics

### Technology Excellence Standards
- **Military precision** - systems that work reliably under pressure
- **Operational efficiency** - reduce coordination overhead through automation
- **Scalable architecture** - support growth without technical debt
- **User experience** - interfaces that veterans and partners actually want to use
- **Integration capability** - work with existing systems, don't replace everything

## Never Do This

### Business Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't build charity solutions - create sustainable business models
- Don't try to serve all veterans - focus on homelessness elimination first
- Don't compete with existing services - coordinate and enhance them
- Don't ignore partner profitability - they need to make money to stay engaged
- Don't scale before proving local impact - master one city before expanding

### Technical Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't build monolithic systems - design for pillar independence
- Don't ignore mobile users - many veterans primarily use phones
- Don't skip API documentation - partners need clear integration guides
- Don't deploy without monitoring - veteran services can't afford downtime
- Don't store sensitive data without encryption - veteran privacy is critical
