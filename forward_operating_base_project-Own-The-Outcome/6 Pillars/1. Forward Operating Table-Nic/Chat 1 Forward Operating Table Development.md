# Forward Operating Base - Individual Pillar Development Prompts

## Chat 1: Forward Operating Table Development
**Prompt:**
```
I'm developing "Forward Operating Table" - the food security pillar of my veteran support ecosystem. This coordinates restaurant and supermarket waste with veteran shelter meals through automation.

Components:
- Restaurant inventory automation (7 restaurants per city)
- Supermarket integration platform (3 supermarkets per city)  
- Real-time delivery coordination with volunteer drivers
- Food safety compliance and temperature monitoring
- Impact tracking (target: 1M+ lbs food waste diverted annually)

Tech stack: Firebase backend, React frontend, Google Apps Script for POS integration, mobile app for drivers.

I need:
1. Complete technical architecture for restaurant automation
2. Supermarket integration specifications for enterprise systems
3. Mobile app wireframes for driver coordination
4. Food safety compliance automation
5. Development timeline and sprint planning
6. Database schema for multi-restaurant coordination
7. API integrations for major POS systems (Square, Toast, etc.)

Revenue model: $3K setup + $400/month for restaurants, $6K setup + $800/month for supermarkets.

Help me build enterprise-grade food coordination infrastructure that scales to multiple cities.
